# Computational Logic for AI Coursework
## Otto Brookes & Amarpal Sahota

We have extended Prolexa to handle the following logical puzzles from [Transformers as Soft Reasoners over Language](https://rule-reasoning.apps.allenai.org/):
- Harry Potter (Imaginary Worlds)
- The Birds Rulebase
- Attributes with Negation
- Conductivity & Counterfactuals

Other information:
- All puzzles should work word-for-word.
- When querying nouns use the format: 'do nails conduct electricity'
- When querying proper nouns use format: 'can harry vanish' or 'is athur an ostrich'

We also handle instances such as 'explain why dursley cannot vanish'


# Repository Information

This repository contains Prolog code for a simple question-answering assistant. The top-level module is `prolexa.pl`, which can either be run in the command line or with speech input and output through the 
[alexa developer console](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask).

The heavy lifting is done in 
`prolexa_grammar.pl`, which defines DCG rules for 
sentences (that are added to the knowledge base if they don't already follow),
questions (that are answered if possible), and
commands (e.g., explain why something follows); and
`prolexa_engine.pl`, which implements reasoning by means of meta-interpreters. 

Also included are `nl_shell.pl`, which is taken verbatim from Chapter 7 of *Simply Logical*, 
and an extended version `nl_shell2.pl`, which formed the basis for the `prolexa` code. 

The code has been tested with [SWI Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org) versions 7.6.0 and 8.0.3.

# Amazon Alexa and Prolog integration #

Follow the steps below if you want to use the Amazon Alexa speech to text and text to speech facilities. 
This requires an HTTP interface that is exposed to the web, for which we use 
[Heroku](http://heroku.com).

## Generating intent json for Alexa ##
```
swipl -g "mk_prolexa_intents, halt." prolexa.pl
```
The intents are found in `prolexa_intents.json`. You can copy and paste the contents of this file while building your skill on the 
[alexa developer console](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask).


## Localhost workflow (Docker) ##
To build:
```
docker build . -t prolexa
```

To run:
```
docker run -it -p 4000:4000 prolexa
```

To test the server:
```
curl -v POST http://localhost:4000/prolexa -d @testjson --header "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## Heroku workflow ##
### Initial setup ###
Prerequisites:

- Docker app running in the background
- Installed Heroku CLI (`brew install heroku/brew/heroku`)

---

To see the status of your Heroku webapp use
```
heroku logs
```

in the prolexa directory.

---

1. Clone this repository
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:So-Cool/prolexa.git
    cd prolexa
    ```

2. Login to Heroku
    ```
    heroku login
    ```

3. Add Heroku remote
    ```
    heroku git:remote -a prolexa
    ```

### Development workflow ###
1. Before you start open your local copy of Prolexa and login to Heroku
    ```
    cd prolexa
    heroku container:login
    ```

2. Change local files to your liking
3. Once you're done push them to Heroku
    ```
    heroku container:push web
    heroku container:release web
    ```

4. Test your skill and repeat steps *2.* and *3.* if necessary
5. Once you're done commit all the changes and push them to GitHub
    ```
    git commit -am "My commit message"
    git push origin master
    ```
